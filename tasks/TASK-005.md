# TASK-005: Adopt the Versioned Context Kit Protocol

Status: Completed
Type: Component
Priority: High
Parent System Task: personal-hermes-agent:TASK-014

## Goal

Adopt the reviewed Context Kit repository profile so this public runtime
repository remains independently recoverable, maintainable, and valid without
private deployment access.

## Completed

- Accepted Context Kit candidate `3f58cb764b587d882099fa17c2a93b4f825cd269`
  as the immutable migration validator for Kit 0.2.0 / project spec v1.
- Completed the read-only migration audit; the existing repository profile is
  compatible and requires only explicit adoption metadata and routing.
- Added the repository profile manifest without changing runtime, deployment,
  or security ownership.
- Passed Context Kit 0.2.0 validation and the repository-native validation
  suite, including 19 Token Observer tests.

## Remaining

None.

## Blockers

None.

## Relevant Files

- PROJECT.md
- AGENTS.md
- .hermes/
- tasks/

## Next Step

None.

## Result

Hermes Self Management now explicitly adopts project spec v1 through Context
Kit 0.2.0's repository profile. Existing implementation and ownership
boundaries remain intact and both protocol and native validation pass.
